# Project: Beans Leaves Disease Detection
This is our college project where we give a beans leaf as an input to the trained model and it returns if the leaf has either Angular Spot or Bean Rust diseases. It returns Healthy if there is no disease.

# Working
0. Go to the release tab.
1. Download the ZIP and extract it anywhere.
2. Inside the extracted folder, you will find the "Leaf Disease Detector.exe" file.
3. Double-click the EXE file to launch the application.
4. The application provides the following options:
   - Load Model – Load an existing trained model (choose between VGG19 or MobileNetV3).
   - Train Model – Train the model from scratch using the dataset if no model is already trained.
   - Predict Disease – Detect whether the bean leaf is Healthy, Angular Spot, or Bean Rust.
5. To predict disease, either drag and drop a bean leaf image into the application or browse and select the image from your system.
6. The prediction result will be displayed on screen with the disease category.
